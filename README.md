# seed-bot

Seed project for creating a conversational bot. Based on the MS Bot Framework.

## Run the app

The app entry point is [app.ts](./src/app.ts).
Run the following commands to clone the project, install its dependencies (**node 6.x required**) and run the bot in console mode.

```sh
git clone git@github.com/Telefonica/seed-bot.git
cd seed-bot

npm install
npm run dev
```

Now, you can type something to start talking with the bot. Just type "Create a note with Hello World".
